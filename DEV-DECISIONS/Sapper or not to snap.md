# Sapper or not ...

At first (Dec 2019), [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) seemed like the perfect couple for Svelte, and off we went...

..until [this problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59274936/how-to-provide-a-global-assert-for-everyone-in-a-sapper-app) surfaced, and debugging it lead to [this discussion](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/issues/383) regarding the role of SSR and Sapper.

Jakob Rosenberg describes my case pretty well:<sub>[link](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/issues/383#issuecomment-533791443)</sub>

We're making SPA.

That list doesn't sound tempting.

Started using Sapper essentially for:

- routing

Let's see the alternatives, then. :)
